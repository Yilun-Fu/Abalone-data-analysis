# Abalone-data-analysis
This is the Final Project of STAT448 Advanced Data Analysis at UIUC in Spring 2022.

## Datasets
The [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone) for the project is based on the abalone data set from UCI’s Machine Learning Database.

## Intro
A seafood wholesaler is interested in differences across sexes of abalone and in relationships between abalone characteristics and the amount of meat. The wholesaler asks for a short report and associated code addressing the following questions. Your analysis should do any necessary diagnostic checking and your report should clearly explain your real-world findings for the wholesaler’s questions of interest.
